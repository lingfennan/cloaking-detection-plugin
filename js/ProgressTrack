TODO:
0. Render spider view on click. Maybe place inside address bar? or on extension icon?
1. Send multiple spider copies.
2. Support multiple modes and use a button to let user choose mode.
3. Build a naive server that requests page and answers (moon.gtisc.gatech.edu).
4. Check whether there is other signals that we can use.
5. Discuss and see whether it is necessary to publish to Chrome webstore https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish

TODO Idea:
1. A way to deal with the login problem is to look for cookies stored by this site, and disable check if there is any.
This may have false negative, but will be efficient.
